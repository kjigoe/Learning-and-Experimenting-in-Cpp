# Learning-and-Experimenting-in-Cpp
First addition of my learning and working in C++
This is my work in learning C++, as my University only provides the option to learn Java OR C++, and I chose Java (same teacher for both
classes that had a HEAVY preference for Java). I have worked fairly extensively with C (see Adtran work), so C++ has not been too much of
a challenge getting all the basics.
